    <p>The PlayStation VR (PS VR, known by its code name Project Morpheus during development) is a virtual reality headset developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment,[5] which was released in October 2016.[1]

It is fully functional with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 home video game consoles. In certain games and demos for the VR, the player wearing the headset acts separately from other players without the headset. The PlayStation VR system can output a picture to both the PlayStation VR headset and a television simultaneously, with the television either mirroring the picture displayed on the headset, or displaying a separate image for competitive or cooperative gameplay. PlayStation VR works with either the standard DualShock 4 controller, PlayStation Move controllers or the PlayStation VR Aim controller.[6]

The PlayStation VR has a 5.7 inch OLED panel, with a display resolution of 1080p.[7][8] The headset also has a processor box which enables the Social Screen video output to the television, as well as process the 3D audio effect, and uses a 3.5mm headphone jack.[7][9] The headset also has nine positional LEDs on its surface for the PlayStation Camera to track 360 degree head movement.[7][10]

As of December 31, 2019, PlayStation VR has sold-through 5 million units worldwide.</p>
